after
test/$stack8 -> test/$stack6
B1.1 and B2.1 are in_process
(through test/$stack8 -> test/$stack6)

then after
main/$stack8  -> main/$stack8
B1.0 is also in process (through main/$stack8  -> main/$stack8)

now, when comparing ($stack8,$stack8) it will subscribe to:
$stack8,$stack8  subscribes to B(1,0),(in_process1=True),(in_process2=True)
$stack8,$stack8  subscribes to B(2,2),(in_process1=False),(in_process2=False)
$stack8,$stack8  subscribes to B(0,0),(in_process1=True),(in_process2=True)

however B(1,0) is wrong. even both, B1.1 and B2.0 are in_process they are cannot be matched
(B1.1 holds [test/$stack6, ] and B2.0 holds [main/$stack8, ])
